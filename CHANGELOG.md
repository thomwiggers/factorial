== 0.4.0 ==

* Fixed a bug (#16) in the implementation which meant that Factorials 37!, 1200!, and possibly others were not computed correctly.
  * Thanks to @marcantoinem for stepping up with the bugfix in (#17)

== 0.3.0 (YANKED) ==

* Implement Prime Swing algorithm, which should massively improve performance, especially for larger factorials. (#9)
  Thanks a lot @marcantoinem!

== 0.2.1 ===

* Fix double factorial for odd numbers (See #6) via the implementation from #5


=== 0.2.0 ====
